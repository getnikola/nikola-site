On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.3.1. This release fixes some small bugs,
including some introduced by the new Nikola Plugin Manager.

The minimum Python version supported is now 3.8, and we have adopted
a formal policy to define the Python versions supported by Nikola.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown â€” and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).
