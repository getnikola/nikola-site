On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce
the immediate availability of Nikola v8.3.3. This is a bugfix release.

We’ve had to release Nikola v8.3.3 immediately after releasing
Nikola v8.3.2, as it is broken on Python 3.8. We would like to thank
the Python packaging ecosystem for being an incomprehensible and
incompatible trainwreck.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Downloads
=========

Install using ``pip install Nikola``.

Changes from v8.3.1
===================

Features
--------

* Trace template usage when an environment variable ``NIKOLA_TEMPLATES_TRACE``
  is set to any non-empty value.
* Give user control over the raw underlying template engine
  (either ``mako.lookup.TemplateLookup`` or ``jinja2.Environment``)
  via an optional ``conf.py`` method ``TEMPLATE_ENGINE_FACTORY``.
* Switch to pyproject.toml
* Add path handler ``slug_source`` linking to source of post.

Bugfixes
--------

* Ignore errors in parsing SVG files for shrinking them, copy original file to output instead
  (Issue #3785)
* Restore ``annotation_helper.tmpl`` with dummy content - fix themes still mentioning it
  (Issue #3764, #3773)
* Fix compatibility with watchdog 4 (Issue #3766)
* ``nikola serve`` now works with non-root SITE_URL.
* Stack traces meaningless for end users now more reliably suppressed (Issue #3838).

Other
-----

* Changed filter for tidy from  ``tidy5`` to ``tidy``.
